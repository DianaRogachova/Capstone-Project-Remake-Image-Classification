# Capstone-Project-Remake-Image-Classification
This is a remake of my Capstone Project on Image Classification using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. I initially worked on this project as a part of my Data Science program at Brainstation in June of 2023. 

Files: 

1. Fruit Image Classification using Scikit-learn library.
2. Fruit Image Classification using TensorFlow platform.

Data: 
For this project I used 'Fruit 360' dataset which is publically accesible on Kaggle.com. The dataset was created by Mihai Oltean, a researcher and a licence holder (Olten, 2021). This extensive dataset consists over 90,300 high-quality images, encompassing of 131 distinct fruit and vegetable classes.
